# Neural Cover Selection for Image Steganography
This repository contains the code for our paper "Neural Cover Selection for image Steganography" by Karl Chahine and Hyeji Kim (NeurIPS 2024).

# Paper Summary
Image steganography embeds secret bit strings within typical cover images, making them imperceptible to the naked eye yet retrievable through specific decoding techniques. The setup is shown below:
