# Neural Cover Selection for Image Steganography
This repository contains the code for our paper "Neural Cover Selection for image Steganography" by Karl Chahine and Hyeji Kim (NeurIPS 2024).

# Paper Summary
Image steganography embeds secret bit strings within typical cover images, making them imperceptible to the naked eye yet retrievable through specific decoding techniques. The encoder takes as input a cover image $\textbf{x}$ and a secret message $\textbf{m}$, outputting a steganographic image $\textbf{s}$ that appears visually similar to the original $\textbf{x}$. The decoder then estimates the message $\hat{\boldsymbol{m}}$ from $\textbf{s}$. The setup is shown below:
